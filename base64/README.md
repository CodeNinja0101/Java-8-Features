Base64 Encoding and Decoding
Overview

Base64 encoding and decoding is a process used to encode binary data into text format, making it safe for storage or transmission over text-based protocols like HTTP, JSON, or XML. This feature is often employed in backend services for tasks such as token encoding, binary file encoding, and secure transmission of sensitive data like images and passwords.

In this module, you will explore how to:

    Encode passwords or tokens for secure storage.
    Encode and decode binary data (such as images) for transmission.
    Use Base64 encoding in REST APIs.

Classes
1. Base64Encoding.java

Demonstrates how to encode a string into Base64 format, commonly used for encoding sensitive data (e.g., passwords or tokens) for secure storage.
2. Base64Decoding.java

Shows how to decode a Base64-encoded string back to its original form, useful for retrieving encoded passwords or tokens during authentication.
3. Base64BinaryData.java

Illustrates encoding and decoding of binary data (e.g., images or files). This is useful when transmitting binary data over a network or storing it in databases.
Key Methods

    Base64 Encoding:

Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(data.getBytes());

Encodes a byte array or string into Base64 format, which is a text-safe encoding mechanism for storing or transmitting binary data.

Base64 Decoding:

    Base64.getDecoder().decode(encodedString);

    Decodes a Base64-encoded string back into its original byte array or string format for further processing or verification.

Practice Scenarios
1. Encoding and Storing Tokens

In real-world applications, tokens such as authentication tokens (JWT) are encoded using Base64 before they are stored in databases. When a user logs in, the stored token is retrieved, decoded, and validated.
2. Decoding Tokens for Authentication

After retrieving the encoded token from the database, decode it to validate its contents during user authentication.
3. Binary Data Encoding for API Responses

When sending binary data (such as images or PDF files) via a REST API, encode the data into Base64 format for safe transmission.
4. Binary Data Decoding from API Requests

When receiving Base64-encoded binary data from a client (e.g., an image file), decode it back to its original format for further processing or storage.
Advantages of Base64

    Text-Safe Format: Base64 is text-based, which makes it easier to transfer binary data through protocols that require text (like JSON or HTTP).
    Data Integrity: Base64 encoding ensures that binary data remains intact during transmission, even if itâ€™s passed through channels that might corrupt raw binary data.
    Easy Decoding: You can easily decode the Base64-encoded data back into its original form for further processing.

Limitations

    Increased Size: The encoded data is approximately 33% larger than the original binary data, which can increase payload size, especially for large files.
    Not Secure: Base64 encoding is not encryption. It merely converts data into a different format, so it should not be used for securing sensitive data like passwords without additional encryption mechanisms.

Conclusion

Base64 encoding and decoding provide a convenient method for handling binary data and sensitive information in Java backend applications. This practice ensures that data can be transmitted safely over text-based protocols and stored securely in databases, especially for tasks like token encoding or binary file handling.
