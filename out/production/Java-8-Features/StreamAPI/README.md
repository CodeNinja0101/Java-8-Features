Java 8 Stream API Practice

What is a Stream?

A Stream is a sequence of data elements that can be processed with various operations. Streams make it easier to handle collections of data (like lists or arrays) in a clear and declarative way.
Key Terms:

    Intermediate Operations: Transform streams, e.g., filter(), map().
    Terminal Operations: End streams, e.g., collect(), reduce().


How to Create Streams

Here are a few common ways to create streams in Java 8:

From a List or Set:

    List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
    Stream<String> stream = list.stream();

From an Array:

    String[] fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
    Stream<String> stream = Arrays.stream(fruits);

Using Stream.of():

    Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("apple", "banana", "cherry");

Using Stream.generate(): Generate a stream with infinite elements. You can limit it using limit().

    Stream<Double> randomStream = Stream.generate(Math::random).limit(5);

Using Stream.iterate(): Generate elements by repeating a function.

    Stream<Integer> evenNumbers = Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 2).limit(5);

From Files:

    Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt"));


Intermediate Operations

    Filtering: filter()
    Mapping: map(), flatMap()
    Sorting: sorted()
    Distinct Elements: distinct()
    Limiting and Skipping: limit(), skip()

Terminal Operations

    Collecting Results: collect(), Collectors.toList(), Collectors.toSet()
    Reduction: reduce()
    Aggregation: count(), sum(), average()
    Matching: anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch()
    Finding Elements: findFirst(), findAny()
    Iteration: forEach()

Collectors

    Grouping Elements: Collectors.groupingBy()
    Partitioning Data: Collectors.partitioningBy()
    Joining Strings: Collectors.joining()
    Mapping Collectors: Collectors.mapping()

Parallel Streams

    Parallel Processing: parallelStream()
    Performance Considerations: When to use parallel streams

Stream Pipeline

    Understanding Stream Pipelines: Combination of intermediate and terminal operations.
    Lazy Evaluation: Operations are executed when terminal operations are invoked.

Optional Handling

    Using Optional: Handling results from operations like findFirst() or findAny().

Best Practices

    Avoiding Statefulness: Avoid operations that depend on external state.
    Performance Considerations: Choosing between sequential and parallel streams.

    StreamReduction.java: Understand how to reduce streams to a single result, such as summing numbers or finding the maximum.

    ParallelStreams.java: Process data in parallel using parallelStream(), which is useful for performance improvement on large datasets.

    StreamCollectors.java: Collect results into different data types, such as lists, sets, or maps, and perform grouping and partitioning.



Basic Stream Operations
1. Filtering Data
 
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]


2. Reducing Data

        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        Integer sum = numbers.stream()
        .reduce(0, Integer::sum); // Sum of numbers
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: 15


3. Parallel Processing

        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        numbers.parallelStream()
        .forEach(System.out::println); // Prints the numbers in parallel
