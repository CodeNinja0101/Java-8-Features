## Overview
Java 8 introduced several important features that enhance how Java applications are developed. In this repository, we focus on the practical application of these features in backend scenarios, such as handling data streams, processing collections, implementing concurrency, and managing time-based operations.

Each feature is accompanied by code examples and explanations, organized in a modular format, to allow easy navigation and practice.

## Features Covered
This repository covers the following Java 8 features with backend-oriented code examples:
- **Lambda Expressions**: Writing cleaner, functional code with lambdas.
- **Streams API**: Processing large data collections in a declarative style.
- **Optional Class**: Handling null values safely in a backend environment.
- **Default Methods in Interfaces**: Extending interfaces without breaking implementations.
- **Method References**: Simplifying code with method references for static and instance methods.
- **New Date and Time API**: Working with dates and times in backend services.
- **Collectors Class**: Grouping, partitioning, and summarizing data.
- **Parallel Streams**: Enhancing performance with parallel data processing.
- **CompletableFuture**: Handling asynchronous tasks in backend services.
- **Base64 Encoding and Decoding**: Encoding data securely for transmission.
